## Issues
    > The app was tested on android 7.0 api 24 and on android 9.0 api 28
    
        on Android 7 api 24 the app crashed when you launched it for the first 
        time but works fine as soon as you give it the nessesarry permissions
        and relaunched.
        
        on Android 9 api 28 the app worked just fine.
        
        ENJOY :)
